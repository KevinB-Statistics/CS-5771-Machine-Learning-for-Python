Whatever you believe, the fact is that linear regression--and its extensions--continues to be a common and useful method of making predictions when the target vector is a quantitative value (e.g. home price, age)"

He observed that very tall parents tended to have children who were tall, but slightly shorter than them. Similarly, very short parents tended to have children who were short, but slightly taller than them.\n",
        "\n",
        "He called this phenomenon \"regression towards mediocrity,\" which was later termed \"regression to the mean.\" He developed a graphical method to describe this relationship, plotting the parents' heights against the children's heights and drawing a line through the data. He used the term \"regression line\" to describe this relationship. This is where the name of the technique comes from, even though today its primary use is for prediction, not just describing this specific biological phenomenon."
